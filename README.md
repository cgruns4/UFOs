# UFO CHALLENGE

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to make a webpage with a dynamic table, working with filters for several different search criteria.  I used combination of
Javascript and HTML to achieve this purpose.  


## RESULTS
One could find use out of this website by researching the details of others who have experienced UFo sightings.  This can be done by using the filters built\
into the site.  A user can select to search by date, city, state, country or shape of unidentified object.  As you can see form the example below, I
have entered a search using the city filter.  the city of Maricopa was selected, and the result was 1 sighting on January 1st with an unkown shape.

## DRAWBACK AND RECOMMENDATION OF THIS NEW DESIGN
The main drawback of this design is that the nav bar in its current states provides no functionality.  My recommendation would be to add a useful navigation bar at the top of the page with options to access other informational pages either to be created within this site, or externally links.  Perhaps with links to images, more detailed stories or investigative reports.  The nav bar in its current states provides no functionality.   Another recommendation would be to add an entry field, where the user can input an email or other personal information so that data can be compiled and used to send out marketing material and assist with improving the user experience.
